# Release GenParker
A combo of **Releaf** and **GenParker**!

## Introduction
As part of [Beslogic's philantropy goal](https://innoverpourlhumanite.org/pages/philanthropie), Beslogic, Canopeum, Genparker are working together to build a solution helping our planet to be a better place. Releaf is a monitoring platform giving the state of trees within a special box of soil and future saplings. It will help individuals to grow their own trees by giving the necessary information to ensure their growth. Once a saperling is ready to be planted, the individual can either plant the trees themselves or give back to a nursery and earn credits in exchange.

## How is it done
Individual will be able to buy a box to grow trees. It will include GenParker hardware helping monitoring the system once ready to start the tree plantation process.

## Rewards
While the plantation process is underway, the individual will unlock achievments for their support. At the end of the process, the individual will be either planting the trees or offer them to a nursery.
